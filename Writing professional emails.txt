Dear Utkarsh,
I hope to find you in good health, so basically I am from India and my native language is Hindi. in India there is high-context communication culture, where the business is done by building relationships and maintaining respectful communication. Individualistic cultures promote the development of individual values and independent social groups. 
One thing other people need to remember when they write to people in your country is that we prefer to build relationships and maintain respectful communication, and the three most important things for writing a professional mail are subject, introduction, and conclusion.
The advice I got from this course is that I got to know the best ways to write professional emails and understand the points to remember while writing one.

Regards
Utkarsh Dubey
